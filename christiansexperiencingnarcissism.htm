<p class="feature"><u class="storyblackbold">NPD. 1 &quot;Experiencing Encouragement In The Dark Times Of Life: Five Common Human Problems and Four Crucial Christian Truths That Guard Our Hearts In The Problems.&quot;</u> emphasized how a person's anger, anxiety, negative self-talk, pessimistic attitudes, and depression {or striking back} were all connected.&nbsp;These five problems begin with lies believed, and took the person into the dark times of life.&nbsp;Four crucial Christian truths were offered to counteract the lies and to provide ways to work to receive healing through the dark times.&nbsp;These truths are the following: </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="feature">Knowing God's love </li>
        <li class="feature"> Recognizing we are only human.&nbsp;We have a spirit that lives in a body and has a
        soul, and all are affected by being human.</li>
        <li class="feature"> Agreeing with God's plan for us as men and women here on earth.&nbsp;Women 
          need to learn to grow into being His Cha-yil woman of power and authority
          [Proverbs 31:10], and the despot [the one who keeps and guides the house] of
          I Tim. 5:14.&nbsp;Men need to grow into loving [John 15:7-17] and especially their
          wives as Christ loves the Church [Eph.5:25].&nbsp;To love requires equality 
        [James&nbsp;2:1-10] and mutual submission [Eph. 5:21], or it isn't love.</li>
        <li class="feature"> Fulfilling our job to remove the blocks that prevent our receiving the miracles God has already prepared for us.&nbsp;The dark times of life are not God's fault. He 
        is not punishing us.&nbsp;By standing on these Truths, we work with the Lord to
        uncover several of the real reasons we are preventing Him from blessing us as He 
              promised in His Word. <u>It is the Truth that heals</u>. Knowing that we can participate
            with God in the dark times of life by believing His Truth is encouragement. The
            Lord's Way is not passive, but mighty to pulling down strongholds.&nbsp;That is the
        heritage of the Christian.<br>

      </p>

      </p>

      <p class="feature">&quot;Dr Alff's CD collection has taught me techniques to cope with people, guard my attitude and reactions, limit the effects of abuse and protect my joy.&nbsp;As I listen I learn strategies to grow stronger and heal a little more.&nbsp;I've grown closer to God, and pray more effectively by listening to them before I go to sleep at night. &quot;</p>
      <p class="feature">&quot;For the first time in my life, I have the Fruits of the Spirit, especially patience, gentleness, kindness and self-control.&nbsp;I always strived to have those fruits, trying for years and now I have them--miraculously!&nbsp;Having the recordings at my fingertips and replaying them was like reaching into a treasure chest and pulling out handfuls of precious gems whenever I wanted. I need to hear things several times to learn.&nbsp;Dr. Alff teaches in a simple step-by-step, matter-of-fact manner how to remove a negative personality cloud, heal the childlike parts of yourself and pray in a productive way for healing.&quot;</p>
      <p class="feature">&quot;Dr. Alff has made it so simple: I do all of this while performing daily activities.&nbsp;I listen and practice while driving, cooking, cleaning...&nbsp;I even practice giving back negative personality clouds during potentially volatile conversations, allowing me to remain calm and to express my emotions and ideas.  </p>
