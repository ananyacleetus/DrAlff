                <p class="storygreen">Personality Disorders</p>
                <p class="feature"> People react to perceived rejection in individual ways. When a child is very little, perceived rejection and the person's individualized reaction to it may form the basis of a personality disorder. It is called a personality disorder because the behavior is abnormal:from early adulthood the person could be counted on to act, think, or interact in a way that wasn't normal in general society. Their behaviour can be harmful, embarrassing, and puzzling. It can negatively influence their growth, friendships, and choices throughout their lifetime. Yet the person may be oblivious to their problem and blame others, in spite of constant comments from others, and the pain their behaviour causes others.
                </p>
                <p class="feature">The ten specific personality disorders identified in the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. Washington DC, American Psychiatric Association, 1994) are the following: Paranoid, Schizoid, Schizotypal, Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, Narcissistic, Avoidant, Dependent, and Obsessive-Compulsive. Specific diagnostic criteria for each personality disorder can be found through online searches.</p>
                <p class="feature">Note: A person may fulfill symptom criteria for several personality disorders at the same time. Sometimes a person may have features of several personality disorders, with not enough symptoms in any one to have that diagnosis. </p>
