                <p>I work to increase psychological well-being in individuals, marriages, families, and workforces by providing trainings in relationship skills. But skills must be practiced. Increasing relationship skills is a life long pursuit. Children learn from behavior that is modeled in the home, church, and community. If these adults did not have relationship skills, they could not model them to the children. Unless those children and adults learned [and practiced] relationship skills from an outside source, the children are set to raise their children with the same lack of skills. Where skills are deficient, it is important to begin as early as possible in the life of an individual, marriage, family, or organization to change ways of dealing with each other.</p>
                <p>Consider this: About 54 percent of all marriages end in divorce and 20 percent of those divorces occur within the first two years. Many divorces occur partly because women and men are not prepared for marriage. Frequently, couples spend more time preparing for the wedding ceremony then for their marriage relationship.</p>
                <p>This office provides training in relationship skills through several excellent programs, listed below. Each program has its own strength, and they can be interwoven as need arises. They are an investment in the future of a business, marriage, or better social relationships.
                    <br> See the disclaimer below.</p>
                <p class="storygreen">Life Innovations:</p>
                <p>Dr. David H. Olson and colleagues at the University of Minnesota have researched the skills that set apart successfully married couples from other marriages. He has identified five types of marriages that range from vitalized [most successful], to harmonious, traditional, conflicted, and devitalized. Dr. Olson, through Life Innovations, created inventories [Prepare &amp; Enrich] to assess the amount of agreement couples have on the major areas creating successful marriages. He then developed programs to help strengthen marriages in these areas. All the trainings are based on the same strengthening principals, but differ somewhat by whether individuals are teens and single adults, engaged, married, or mature couples over age fifty facing transitions. Each group has their own program. His research has shown that couples have moved from a more conflicted type to a more successful type by participating in his relationship skill training.</p>
                <p>The trainings address couple relationship strengths and growth areas. They also discuss communication; assertiveness; active listening; conflict resolution; couple relationships compared to family of origin relationships; personality issues; financial management; spiritual beliefs; children and parenting; family and friends; realistic expectations; leisure activities; developing a budget; and setting personal and couple goals. <a href="http://www.lifeinnovations.com%20" target="_blank">www.lifeinnovations.com </a>

                <p>Rev. Dr. Edward Santana-Grace noticed that anger and anxiety prevented effective relationships. He researched both and developed programs for businesses, schools, families, and individuals to get control of their emotions so they could learn how to interact appropriately.
