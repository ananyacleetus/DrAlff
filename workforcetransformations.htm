                To Hire And Retain Good Employees</h3>

                <p class="feature">To hire and train a new employee is
                costly.&nbsp; Estimates range from 33-50% of a worker&rsquo;s
                annual salary to hire and train a new worker.&nbsp; This figure
                does not include the expense of having to replace a new hire
                because they don&rsquo;t fit the job as originally expected, or
                the loss of productivity if a retained new hire doesn&rsquo;t
                perform as needed.&nbsp; Hiring good employees, quickly, is
                financially profitable.</p>

                <p>&nbsp; Here are some tips to:</p>

                <p class="feature">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find and retain the
                right fit for the job</p>

                <p class="feature">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Reduce selection costs</p>

                <h1 class="feature">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilize the strengths of
                employees</h1>

                <p class="feature">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                Lessen work stress and reduce sick days</p>

                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Develop a written
                job description</span>.&nbsp; Include the manager of the new
                hire position in this decision.&nbsp; Utilize psychological
                testing to indicate the needed intensity of&nbsp; the new
                hire&rsquo;s way of working.</p>

                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Know the
                applicant</span>.&nbsp; It is imperative to confirm the details
                on a resume by contacting former employers, references and
                schools, as well as conducting a brief interview.</p>

                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Determine, through
                psychological testing, how their style of working will be
                played out in the workplace</span>.&nbsp; This is
                crucial.&nbsp; For example, a person whose style requires a
                well-thought out, orderly sequence of tasks, will be under
                extreme stress if placed into a position that requires snap
                decisions, working in chaos with conflicting instructions,
                improvising, and taking chances.&nbsp; This stress of working
                against themselves contributes to sick days. The Kolbe is
                without peer in this area.</p>

                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Define, through
                testing, their style of interacting with others</span>.&nbsp; A
                person who works best alone will be highly stressed interacting
                in a constant team format. The FIRO-B is excellect here.</p>

                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Train staff and
                workers to produce a workplace of respect and appreciation for
                each individual</span>.&nbsp; Management by confrontation and
                criticism quickly produces anger, resentment, low self-esteem,
                high stress, and employee turnover in a good employee that is
                the right fit for the job.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center">For Jubilee March / April 2009,
                Vol. XXVI Copyright 2009 by Dr. Mardee Alff, Psy.D.&nbsp; All
                rights reserved.</p>

                <p>It may seem strange to think of every business as having a
                soul, but it does. Just as a family takes on the personality of
                the parents and the extended family, and a Church the
                personality of the leaders and founding fathers, so does a
                business take on the personality of the leaders and owners.</p>

                <p>To explain how this works, I would like to introduce to you
                Shelley and her father.&nbsp; I visited Shelley with her
                parents and siblings many years ago when she was in first
                grade.</p>

                <p>Shelley's Dad was an amazingly talented young man.&nbsp; He
                maximized the space in their small home by making a wood bunk
                bed for each of his children that he designed with built-in
                drawers underneath and an integrated desk.&nbsp; [We are
                accustomed to seeing this type of space saving design in
                stores.&nbsp; But it was very unique at this time in
                1946.]&nbsp;</p>

                <p>He enjoyed constructing these creations, and he enjoyed his
                family and people.&nbsp; He carried these skills over to the
                business world by founding an electronics firm in a small town
                across the river from the state capital.</p>

                <p>He treated his employees like they were the company's
                greatest asset.&nbsp; He paid them a good wage, provided
                benefits, and good working conditions. He provided a stable
                work atmosphere of appreciation where the worker's soul
                [intellect, will, and emotion] could flourish.&nbsp; People
                enjoyed coming to work, and as a result, absenteeism and sick
                leave were rare. As an over-flow blessing, the employees'
                personal lives and families flourished, as did the greater
                community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>At the end of the year, he shared profits with them.&nbsp;
                This was so unheard of at that time that people flocked to
                apply to work for him.&nbsp; There was always a long waiting
                list for employment because his workers never left for other
                jobs.</p>

                <p>Over the years, his electronics firm expanded into a much
                larger plant outside town.&nbsp; He continued to prosper
                because of the atmosphere he created for his employees to
                succeed.</p>

                <p>Years later, Shelley's Dad died suddenly. Shelly and her
                siblings were grown and living with their own families
                scattered across the country.&nbsp; They tried to continue
                running the company, but found it impossible to do so.&nbsp;
                Finally, they sold the electronics firm.</p>

                <p>The new company leaders and owners had a different soul and
                it was sadly like the other companies in the area.&nbsp;
                Workers were not honored.&nbsp; In a short time turnover,
                absenteeism, and productivity mirrored the surrounding
                companies. Families and community ceased to flourish.</p>

                <p>I was privileged to watch Shelley's Father positively change
                family and community by respecting and honoring
                employees.&nbsp; Conversely, it was horrifying to watch that
                atmosphere as it was immediately erased by a change in
                leadership soul. Just as a small child is known by his/her
                deeds, so is a company known by its treatment of employees, and
                the atmosphere it creates for their workers, the worker's
                family, and the greater community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Since then I have watched other companies honoring workers,
                yet end up with lay-offs and plant closings.&nbsp; There are
                always reasons.&nbsp; Some reasons are more quickly discovered
                than others.&nbsp; For example, shareholders of a publicly
                traded company may have a different agenda than success of the
                company through honoring the employees. The same may be true of
                employees, unions, and leadership.&nbsp; Or there may be strife
                among workers at any level.&nbsp; There may be a need for soul
                integration in the leadership if they are controlled by
                negative attitudes and fears. What we fear comes upon us.</p>

                <p>At other times, there can be a need for a Spiritual
                Consultation to look into the company's history. There can be a
                trauma in the history of the company, or previously on the
                property, that needs reconciled for the company to
                flourish.&nbsp; In previous Jubilee columns on the <a href=
                "soulintegration.htm">Experiencing Soul Restoration page</a>,
                we have talked about the way individuals can step outside the
                wall of God's protection.&nbsp; Businesses can do the
                same.&nbsp; A Spiritual Consultation will uncover the problem,
                and prepare the reconciliation needed to come back within God's
                wall of protection.&nbsp; Only the company leadership can
                decide what to do with this information.&nbsp; The business
                soul of a company is crucial for its leaders to monitor because
                the long-term success of the company depends on it.</p>
